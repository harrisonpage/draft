# Draft

A bare-bones static site and blog generator, nothing more.

Entirely configured with command-line arguments. Given a series of templates, convert Markdown to HTML files.

No support for packaging external files, images, deployment or hosting. Just a site generator.

## Folders

The following directories are necessary. Directory names can be customized in the configuration file.

* **`badges`**: SVG icons used across the application
* **`templates`**: HTML templates for rendering content
* **`posts`**: Collection of blog posts to be generated
* **`output`**: HTML files are saved here

Posts are processed and rendered in the order of their file names, new to old. To ensure proper ordering, it is recommended to name your blog post files using the following format:

```text
YYYYMMDD.descriptive.title.md
```

Example:

```text
20250101.happy.new.year.md
```

## Environment Variables

Run `build.sh`. (Sets `DRAFT_BUILD_VERSION` and runs `make`.)

## Configuration

Descriptions of each field in `config.yaml`:

* **`input_dir`**: Directory containing Markdown source files

* **`templates_dir`**: Directory containing HTML template files

* **`output_dir`**: Directory where generated HTML files will be written

* **`index_template_path`**: Path to HTML template used for the main index page

* **`tags_index_template_path`**: Path to HTML template used for the tags index page

* **`tag_page_template_path`**: Path to HTML template used for individual tag pages

* **`author`**: Author name, displayed in generated pages

* **`blog_name`**: Blog name, displayed in metadata and header

* **`copyright`**: Copyright notice, displayed in metadata and footer

* **`description`**: Brief description, one paragraph or so, used in link unfurls

* **`email`**: Email address, optional. Appears in a meta tag in the header and also wrapped with an `<address>` tag in the footer

* **`lang`**: Language as specified in the `<html>` tag e.g. "en"

* **`language`**: Language identifier for the generated pages in the format `language-region` (e.g., `en-us` for English, United States)

* **`css_files`**: List of URLs or file paths for CSS stylesheets to include

* **`js_files`**: List of URLs or file paths for JavaScript files to include

* **`url`**: Root URL of the website, used for generating absolute links

* **`base_path`**: Optional prefix for all URLs, just `blog` for a URL like <https://www.example.com/blog/>

* **`back_label`**: Label for back links

* **`pages`**: List of sub-pages to build

* **`badges`**: List of badges and links

* **`fediverse_creator`**: Optional Mastodon username e.g. `@harrisonpage@defcon.social`

## Pages

The `pages` block should be in this format:

```yaml
pages:
  - template: about.html
    title: About
    link: about
```

The about.html template will be written here: .../about/index.html.

## Badges

The `badges` block might look like this:

```yaml
badges:
  - title: "Photography"
    url: "https://harrison.photography"
    icon: "camera"
```

The `icon` field refers to an SVG file in the `badges` folder. For example, `camera` maps to `badges/camera.svg`.

[Lucide](https://lucide.dev) is an excellent resource for SVG icons.

## Fediverse Integration

* If the `fediverse_creator` configuration field is filled out, a `fediverse:creator` header will appear on all pages

## Templates

The `templates` folder contains these files:

* **`default.html`**: Post template, can be changed per-post
* **`index.html`**: Home page, contains most recent post and an index
* **`tags.html`**: List of all tags used, example [here](https://harrison.blog/tags/)
* **`tag.html`**: Page showcasing individual tags, example [here](https://harrison.blog/tags/code/)
* **`shared.html`**: Top and bottom matter shared among all pages

### Examples

These templates are examples of custom pages as specified in the configuration file.

* about.html
* colophon.html

## Posts

A blog post has a header and a body. The header is surrounded by three dashes: YAML front matter.

Example:

```markdown
---
